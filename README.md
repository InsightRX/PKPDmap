# PKPDmap

MAP Bayesian and non-parametric data fitting for PK(PD) models.

## Description

This R library implements various methods for fitting of individual PK(PD) data. For simulation of PK(PD) profiles it uses the `PKPDsim` library. The following estimation methods are implemented and available in the `get_map_estimates` function:

- `map`: MAP Bayesian: standard maximum a priori estimation of empirical Bayes estimates
- `map_flat_prior`: MAP Bayesian with flat prior: reduced weight of prior distribution, i.e. will put more trust in the data and hence reduce shrinkage (user can control the weighting).
- `ls`: Least Squares: not *truly* least squares but rather special case of MAP Bayesian with flat priors, i.e. with (almost) fully flat prior.
- `np`: non-parametric estimation. Performs non-parametric estimation based on user-specified parameter matrix of previously studied subjects.
- `np_hybrid`: hybrid MAP and non-parametric extended grid. Will first perform standard MAP estimation (potentially with flattened prior), and subsequently perform non-parametric estimation on grid of support points around MAP estimates.

## Installation

The development version of PKPDmap always has the most up-to-date improvements
and bug fixes. We aim to release PKPDmap on CRAN soon as well.

The development version of PKPDsim can be installed using:

```
devtools::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDmap")
```
